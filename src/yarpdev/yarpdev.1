.SH NAME
yarpdev \- The standard YARP device utility
The command-line utility 'yarpdev' can create devices and wrap them for network visibility.
.PP
This is useful in cases where you wish to control devices on remote machines.
.PP
If you do not have the 'yarpdev' utility, you need to ask CMake to build it. run 'ccmake .' (on UNIX) or 'cmake' (on Windows) on the root directory of the YARP source code and select the 'CREATE_DEVICE_LIBRARY' option. After you configure, new 'ENABLE_*' options will appear that permit you to choose what devices you want to try and compile.
.SH "yarpdev"
.PP
The utility gives a message if called with no arguments to confirm that it exists, and to give tips on where to get started using it. Our current implementation says:
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ yarpdev
Welcome to yarpdev, a program to create YARP devices
To see the devices available, try:
   yarpdev --list
To create a device whose name you know, call yarpdev like this:
   yarpdev --device DEVICENAME --OPTION VALUE ...
For example:
   yarpdev --device test_grabber --width 32 --height 16 --name /grabber
You can always move options to a configuration file:
   yarpdev [--device DEVICENAME] --file CONFIG_FILENAME
If you have problems, you can add the "verbose" flag to get more information
   yarpdev --verbose --device ffmpeg_grabber
.fi
.PP
.SH "yarpdev --list"
.PP
With the --list option present, the devices available on your system are listed. For example:
.PP
.PP
.nf

$ yarpdev --list
Here are devices listed for your system:
Device "dragonfly", C++ class DragonflyDeviceDriver, wrapped by "grabber"
Device "esd", C++ class EsdMotionControl, wrapped by "controlboard"
Device "esd_sniffer", C++ class EsdMessageSniffer, has no network wrapper
Device "microphone", C++ class MicrophoneDeviceDriver, wrapped by "grabber"
Device "inertiacube2", C++ class InertiaCube2, has no network wrapper
Device "jamesarmcalibrator", C++ class JamesArmCalibrator, has no network wrapper
Device "jameshead", C++ class JamesHead, has no network wrapper
Device "XSensMTx", C++ class XSensMTx, wrapped by "inertial"
Device "portaudio", C++ class PortAudioDeviceDriver, wrapped by "grabber"
Device "opencv_grabber", C++ class OpenCVGrabber, wrapped by "grabber"
Device "ffmpeg_grabber", C++ class FfmpegGrabber, wrapped by "grabber"
Device "test_grabber", C++ class TestFrameGrabber, wrapped by "grabber"

Device "grabber", C++ class ServerFrameGrabber, is a network wrapper.
Device "inertial", C++ class ServerInertial, is a network wrapper.
Device "sound_grabber", C++ class ServerSoundGrabber, is a network wrapper.
Device "remote_controlboard", C++ class RemoteControlBoard, wrapped by "controlboard"
Device "controlboard", C++ class ServerControlBoard, is a network wrapper.
.fi
.PP
.SH "yarpdev --device DEVICENAME --OPTION1 VALUE1 ..."
.PP
This is the normal way to start up a device. For example: 
.PP
.nf

$ yarpdev --device test_grabber --period 0.5 --width 640 --height 480
Test grabber period 0.5 / freq 2, mode [line]
yarpdev: created device <test_grabber>.  See C++ class TestFrameGrabber for documentation.
yarp: Port /grabber listening at tcp://130.251.4.155:10032
Grabber for images
No framerate specified, polling the device
yarpdev: created wrapper <grabber>.  See C++ class ServerFrameGrabber for documentation.
yarpdev: device active...
yarpdev: device active...
...

.fi
.PP
.PP
Here we've asked to create the 'test_grabber' device, which acts as a fake image source. We've specified the image size and the rate at which images are created. The yarpdev program eventually said 'device active' -- this is a good sign.
.PP
The program reported that the 'test_grabber' device was created. It also mentions a 'grabber' device that is also created. Why is this? It is because most devices themselves know nothing about the network; instead they need to be 'wrapped' in a special 'network wrapper device' that knows how to put them on the network. For test_grabber and other camera-like devices, this wrapper is called 'grabber'. In fact, our original request of: 
.PP
.nf

$ yarpdev --device test_grabber --period 0.5 --width 640 --height 480

.fi
.PP
 was automatically expanded to: 
.PP
.nf

$ yarpdev --device grabber --subdevice test_grabber --period 0.5 --width 640 --height 480

.fi
.PP
.SH "yarpdev --verbose --device DEVICENAME  ..."
.PP
If we add the '--verbose' flag, yarpdev will report information about device configuration. This can help a lot to work out what properties a device takes. For example, suppose we notice in the documentation that there is an 'ffmpeg_grabber' which can read images from an avi file. But what options should we supply it? To find out, just add the '--verbose' flag and try to create the device without any options: 
.PP
.nf

$ yarpdev --verbose --device ffmpeg_grabber
Could not open avi file default.avi
yarpdev: ***ERROR*** driver <ffmpeg_grabber> was found but could not open
yarpdev: ***ERROR*** driver <grabber> was found but could not open
===============================================================
== Options checked by device:
==

yarpdev: ***ERROR*** device not available.
Suggestions:
+ Do "yarpdev --list" to see list of supported devices.
+ Or append "--verbose" option to get more information.

.fi
.PP
.PP
The '--verbose' option adds the 'options checked by device' information. We see that for the ffmpeg_grabber, there is an option called 'source' which defaults to 'default.avi' and is the 'movie file to read from'. Now if we do: 
.PP
.nf

$ yarpdev --device ffmpeg_grabber --source your_movie.avi

.fi
.PP
 The device starts correctly.
.PP
The '--verbose' information also mentioned an option called 'v4l' with the comment 'if present, read from video4linux'. If we try adding this option, yarpdev may or may not succeed (depending on whether video4linux is present and how it is configured on your machine). A typical failed output is: 
.PP
.nf

$ yarpdev --verbose --device ffmpeg_grabber --v4l
/dev/video0: No such file or directory
Could not open Video4Linux input
yarpdev: ***ERROR*** driver <ffmpeg_grabber> was found but could not open
yarpdev: ***ERROR*** driver <grabber> was found but could not open

 So now we see another level of configuration which we can do to make the device match our system.
