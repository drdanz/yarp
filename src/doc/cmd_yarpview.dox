/**
 * @page yarpview The YARP image viewer

This is for viewing images transmitted in standard network format.

@section yarpview_base yarpview /PORTNAME
This is the most common usage.  Starts up a viewer, listing with
a given port name.  Then if we have an image source, for example:
\verbatim
yarpdev --device test_grabber --name /grabber
\endverbatim
We can connect it and see what it is doing:
\verbatim
yarp connect /grabber /PORTNAME
\endverbatim

This usage is a shorthand for "yarpview --name /PORTNAME".

@section yarpview_click yarpview --name /PORTNAME --out /CLICK

This adds an output port which produces a pair of coordinates
every time the user clicks on the video stream.  For example,
you can view this output with:
\verbatim
yarp read /read /CLICK
\endverbatim

Note that this will only work if at least one image has been shown by
the viewer (the image is needed to establish the scale).

@section yarpview_pos yarpview --x X_POSITION --y Y_POSITION

Adding these options will place the viewer at the specified location.

@section yarpview_size yarpview --w WIDTH --h HEIGHT

Adding these options will create the viewer with the specified size.

@section yarpview_framerate Setting the framerate

To set the framerate with which the viewer updates the image:

\verbatim
yarpview --p framerate
\endverbatim

Newer versions of yarpview: you can ask yarpview to display all images that are received on the port:
\verbatim
yarpview --synch
\endverbatim

In this way (if there is enough CPU time free) all images received from the port will be 
displayed in the screen. This is useful if you do not want to lose frames.

@section yarpview_help yarpview --help
Print a simple help with all parameters and their usage. This is available only if yarpview
has access to a console (it depends on the OS).
