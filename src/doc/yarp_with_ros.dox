 * @page yarp_with_ros Using YARP with ROS

\author Paul Fitzpatrick

Programs that use YARP ports may interoperate with the ROS
"Robot Operating System" in several ways.  The methods 
described here are available in part from YARP version 2.3.4 on,
and in full from YARP version 2.3.7.

We call the ROS middleware "ROSCORE" to distinguish it from
the broader set of packages that make up the ROS ensemble.

\section yarp_with_ros_requirements Requirements

Make sure YARP is compiled with the following carriers enabled:
\li xmlrpc_carrier, needed for name server communication
\li tcpros_carrier, needed for peer-to-peer communication

To achieve this, run CMake for YARP, and turn on the
"CREATE_OPTIONAL_CARRIERS" option, then configure, then
turn on the "ENABLE_yarpcar_tcpros_carrier" and 
"ENABLE_yarpcar_xmlrpc_carrier" option.

YARP does not link to any parts of the ROS codebase, so don't
worry about how to tell YARP where to find the ROS libraries,
it doesn't need them.

\section yarp_with_ros_name_server Sharing a name server

Both YARP and ROSCORE assume that a specialized name server is
available for their use (but see also \ref yarp_without_nameserver).
It seems a little goofy to need two name servers, so
if instructed, YARP will use ROSCORE's name server (the "roscore" program).
Here's how.  First, make sure you have started roscore:
\verbatim
roscore
\endverbatim
Make sure that the ROS_MASTER_URI environment variable is set as roscore
proposes.
Now, place YARP in a new namespace, called for example "/ros"
itself
\verbatim
yarp namespace /ros
\endverbatim
Then ask YARP to detect a nameserver and save its address:
\verbatim
yarp detect --ros --write
\endverbatim
This should report something along the lines of:
\verbatim
Trying ROS_MASTER_URI=http://127.0.0.1:11311...
Reachable.  Writing.
Configuration stored.  Testing.
Looking for name server on 127.0.0.1, port number 11311
If there is a long delay, try:
  yarp conf --clean
ROS Name server /rossy is available at ip 127.0.0.1 port 11311
\endverbatim

An alternative procedure is to manually configure YARP to use a ROS 
name server with a particular host name or ip address and port number:
\verbatim
yarp conf icubsrv 11311 ros
\endverbatim

YARP ports should be usable at the point.  To test this, you could run:
\verbatim
yarp check
\endverbatim
Or try some of the exercises in \ref note_ports.

YARP ports should behave as normal.
One caveat: the <i>multicast</i> protocol requires some support from the name server
that ROSCORE does not currently provide.  
So don't use multicast if you want to work also
with ROS (or use multiple name servers).

\section yarp_with_ros_connecting Connecting ports with publishers/subscribers

YARP ports can publish or subscribe to ROS topics.  For example, suppose
a ROS node called "/talker" is publishing strings to a ROS topic
called "/chatter".  To listen in using "yarp read", we could do:
\verbatim
yarp read /read-#/chatter
\endverbatim

For YARP, "/read-#/chatter" is just another port name.  For ROS, it means:
 \li Treat this port as belonging to a virtual ROS node called "/read".
 \li Make this port a subscriber to the /chatter topic (for twitter users,
read as "pull messages out of hash-tag /chatter").

Alternatively, this works as well:
\verbatim
yarp read /read topic://chatter
\endverbatim
In general, connections to topics can be made and broken using 
"yarp connect" and "yarp disconnect" (or, from code, Network::connect
and Network::disconnect) as usual, with the names of topics 
preceded by "topic://".  There's a mismatch between the lifetimes 
of topics in YARP and ROS that makes this a bit messy right now.

Suppose a ROS node called "/listener" is listening for strings on the 
ROS topic "/chatter".  We can send it strings by doing:
\verbatim
yarp write /write+#/chatter
\endverbatim
Be sure to type strings only, for example:
\verbatim
"hello there"
bye
\endverbatim
Otherwise you'll get a warning that your input is not of the expected
type.

This works as well:
\verbatim
yarp write /write topic://chatter
\endverbatim
But with the same caveat as for "yarp read topic://chatter /read".

When sending or receiving "real" datatypes (not just strings), it
is necessary to work with ros types: see \ref yarp_with_ros_types.

\section yarp_with_ros_types Using ROS types

The biggest difference between YARP and ROSCORE is that YARP
doesn't really care what data you send between ports, while ROSCORE
cares deeply.

So in general, connections to or from ROS need to be typed.
ROS types are defined in ".msg" files which are compiled into
ROS C++ code during ROS builds.  As of YARP 2.3.4, those .msg files can 
also be converted into YARP C++ code, or read at runtime, using the
"yarpros" tool.  Consider the following .msg file, "PointCloud2.msg":
\verbatim
#This message holds a collection of nD points, as a binary blob.
Header header

# 2D structure of the point cloud. If the cloud is unordered,
# height is 1 and width is the length of the point cloud.
uint32 height
uint32 width

# Describes the channels and their layout in the binary data blob.
PointField[] fields

bool    is_bigendian # Is this data bigendian?
uint32  point_step   # Length of a point in bytes
uint32  row_step     # Length of a row in bytes
uint8[] data         # Actual point data, size is (row_step*height)

bool is_dense        # True if the data is dense (i.e., image-like organized)
\endverbatim
This refers in turn to "Header" and "PointField".  If those are
also available, running "yarpros type PointCloud2" will generate 
the needed header files for YARP, including PointCloud2.h:
\code
#ifndef YARPROS_TYPE_PointCloud2
#define YARPROS_TYPE_PointCloud2

#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <yarp/os/Portable.h>
#include <TickTime.h>
#include <Header.h>
#include <PointField.h>

class PointCloud2 : public yarp::os::Portable {
public:
  Header header;
  int height;
  int width;
  std::vector<PointField> fields;
  bool is_bigendian;
  int point_step;
  int row_step;
  std::vector<char> data;
  bool is_dense;

  bool read(yarp::os::ConnectionReader& connection) {
    // *** header ***
    if (!header.read(connection)) return false;

    // *** height ***
    height = connection.expectInt();

    // *** width ***
    width = connection.expectInt();

    // *** fields ***
    int len = connection.expectInt();
    fields.resize(len);
    for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {
      if (!fields[i].read(connection)) return false;
    }

    // *** is_bigendian ***
    if (!connection.expectBlock((char*)&is_bigendian,1)) return false;

    // *** point_step ***
    point_step = connection.expectInt();

    // *** row_step ***
    row_step = connection.expectInt();

    // *** data ***
    len = connection.expectInt();
    data.resize(len);
    if (!connection.expectBlock((char*)&data[0],sizeof(char)*len)) return false;

    // *** is_dense ***
    if (!connection.expectBlock((char*)&is_dense,1)) return false;
    return true;
  }

  bool write(yarp::os::ConnectionWriter& connection) {
    // *** header ***
    if (!header.write(connection)) return false;

    // *** height ***
    connection.appendInt(height);

    // *** width ***
    connection.appendInt(width);

    // *** fields ***
    connection.appendInt(fields.size());
    for (int i=0; i<fields.size(); i++) {
      if (!fields[i].write(connection)) return false;
    }

    // *** is_bigendian ***
    connection.appendBlock(&is_bigendian,1);

    // *** point_step ***
    connection.appendInt(point_step);

    // *** row_step ***
    connection.appendInt(row_step);

    // *** data ***
    connection.appendInt(data.size());
    connection.appendExternalBlock((char*)&data[0],sizeof(char)*data.size());

    // *** is_dense ***
    connection.appendBlock(&is_dense,1);
    return !connection.isError();
  }
};

#endif
\endcode
The PointCloud2 datatype can then be used to communicate with 
a ROS topic of that type (see \ref port_expert for background).



\section yarp_with_ros_existing Reading existing YARP ports from ROS

To read existing YARP ports from ROS, we need to define their
type for ROS's benefit.  There is a tool to help with this.

For testing purposes, let's start a fake motor control board:
\verbatim
yarpdev --device test_motor --name /motor
\endverbatim

One of the ports this creates is /motor/state:o.  ROS forbids
port names with ":" in them, and YARP versions 2.3.15 and earlier 
didn't have a work-around for this, so make sure you are using
YARP trunk or YARP version > 2.3.15 for this part.

To see how to access /motor/state:o from ROS, do:
\verbatim
yarpros sniff out /motor/state:o
\endverbatim
This gives us the following rather arcane lines:
\verbatim
int32 v_tag # set to 266 (BOTTLE_TAG_LIST+code)
float64[] v # suggested length: 4
\endverbatim
This is a valid .msg file, and can be used directly in ROS.

See some more examples in the yarp source code, in the 
example/yarpros_examples directory.


\section yarp_with_ros_link How ROS and YARP are linked

ROS and YARP are linked based on
the entities that are individually addressable
on the network.  For YARP, these are primarily "port" names:
\verbatim
$ yarp name query /read
registration name /read ip 10.42.43.1 port 10002 type tcp
\endverbatim
For ROS, these are primarily "node" names:
\verbatim
$ rosnode info /talker
Node [/talker]
...
contacting node http://icubsrv:38770/ ...
Pid: 15083
\endverbatim

In YARP, the relationship between "port" names and network addresses
is stored by a program called "yarpserver".  In ROS, the relationship
between "node" names and network addresses is stored by a program
called "roscore".

Now let's think about how connections are named.  In YARP, a
connection is created by the user or a manager program between two
named ports.  In ROS, connections are created by roscore between two
named nodes (there's an important detail about "topics" we'll come right
back to).

By equating ports in YARP with nodes in ROS, we get that:
 \li Matching entities are network-addressable.
 \li Connections are between matching entities.

A difference between YARP and ROS is that in ROS, roscore manages
connections based on "topic names".  Each node can declare that it
"publishes" or "subscribes" to a set of topic names.  Each node that
publishes to a given topic name will be connected to each node that
subscribes to that topic name.  In YARP, logic for topic names exists
in yarpserver (see \ref persistent_connections_topics)
but is rarely used; connections are usually made in a
less restricted way.  For YARP/ROS interoperability, the set of
ports/nodes that need to interoperate should stick with the topic-style
connection rule.

It is convenient, when talking about YARP and ROS together,
to call ports and nodes "portnodes".  YARP and ROS agree
that portnodes are individually network-addressable, and connections
are made between pairs of portnodes.

In ROS, there is one portnode per program, and a single portnode can
publish/subscribe distinct data to many topics.  In YARP there
may be many portnodes per program, and each portnode can
publish/subscribe a single type of data to many topics.  This 
difference doesn't seem to be a deal-breaker so far, and allows
existing YARP programs to be used with ROS without 
any source-code modification.

\section yarp_with_ros_admin How ROS and YARP are linked: administrative messages

In ROS, administrative messages are transmitted using XMLRPC.  The
network address for a node is expected to point to a listener
expecting XMLRPC messages.  With an optional carrier, YARP ports become
also willing to speak XMLRPC (see settings in \ref yarp_with_ros_requirements).
Of course they continue to also accept all other YARP carriers
(see \ref carrier_config).

The roscore program will expect nodes to respond to particular
commands expressed in XMLRPC.  Key ones are:
 \li publisherUpdate
 \li requestTopic

With the XMLRPC carrier, YARP ports would receive these messages in a
format they understand, but didn't know what to do with them.  Support
has since been added to process these requests appropriately.  So YARP
ports now understand both YARP native administrative messages, and
basic ROS administrative messages.  


\section yarp_with_ros_types How ROS and YARP are linked: types

ROS uses a simple IDL to describe structures.  For example, 
we can define a structure of three floating point numbers in a file
called Point.msg:
\verbatim
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
\endverbatim
For use in ROS C++ clients, this .msg file would be first converted
to a .h with appropriate serializers.  It is straightforward
to convert .msg files to YARP-style serializers, and
this has been implemented, see \ref yarp_with_ros_types.
Currently, Point.msg would convert to:
\code
// This is an automatically generated file.
// Generated from this Point.msg definition:
//   float64 x
//   float64 y
//   float64 z
// Instances of this class can be read and written with YARP ports,
// using a ROS-compatible format.

#ifndef YARPMSG_TYPE_Point
#define YARPMSG_TYPE_Point

#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <yarp/os/Portable.h>
#include <yarp/os/ConstString.h>
#include <yarp/os/NetInt32.h>
#include <yarp/os/NetInt64.h>
#include <yarp/os/NetFloat32.h>
#include <yarp/os/NetFloat64.h>

class Point : public yarp::os::Portable {
public:
  yarp::os::ConstString getTypeName() const {
    return "Point";
  }

  yarp::os::NetFloat64 x;
  yarp::os::NetFloat64 y;
  yarp::os::NetFloat64 z;

  bool read(yarp::os::ConnectionReader& connection) {
    // *** x ***
    x = connection.expectDouble();

    // *** y ***
    y = connection.expectDouble();

    // *** z ***
    z = connection.expectDouble();
    return !connection.isError();
  }

  bool write(yarp::os::ConnectionWriter& connection) {
    // *** x ***
    connection.appendDouble(x);

    // *** y ***
    connection.appendDouble(y);

    // *** z ***
    connection.appendDouble(z);
    return !connection.isError();
  }
};

#endif
\endcode

Here's an example program to write such points:
\code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <yarp/os/all.h>
#include "yarp/Point.h"

using namespace yarp::os;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Network yarp;
  BufferedPort<Point> port;
  if (argc!=2) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Please supply port name\n");
    return 1;
  }
  if (!port.open(argv[1])) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Failed to open port\n");
    return 1;
  }
  while (true) {
    Point& pt = port.prepare();
    pt.x = 10;
    pt.y = 20;
    pt.z = 30;
    printf("Wrote point %g %g %g\n", pt.x, pt.y, pt.z);
    port.write();
    Time::delay(0.5);
  }

  return 0;
}
\endcode

To write the points on a topic called "/point", call 
this program with a port name like "/foo+#/point".

Here's an example program to read such points:
\code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <yarp/os/all.h>
#include "yarp/Point.h"

using namespace yarp::os;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Network yarp;
  BufferedPort<Point> port;
  if (argc!=2) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Please supply port name\n");
    return 1;
  } 
  if (!port.open(argv[1])) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Failed to open port\n");
    return 1;
  }

  while (true) {
    Point *pt = port.read();
    if (!pt) continue;
    printf("Read point %g %g %g\n", pt->x, pt->y, pt->z);
  }

  return 0;
}
\endcode

To read the points from a topic called "/point", call 
this program with a port name like "/bar-#/point".
