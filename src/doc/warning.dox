 Through Me Pass into the Painful City,
 Through Me Pass into Eternal Grief,
 Through Me Pass among the Lost People.
 Justice Moved My Master-Builder:
 Heavenly Power First Fashioned Me
 With Highest Wisdom and with Primal Love.
 Before Me Nothing Was Created That
 Was Not Eternal, and I Last Eternally.
 All Hope Abandon, You Who Enter Here.
