Description: thin middleware for humanoid robots and more - data
 YARP stands for Yet Another Robot Platform. It is a library and toolkit
 for communication and device interfaces, used on everything from
 humanoids to embedded devices.
 .
 More specifically, YARP supports building a robot control system as a
 "collection of programs" communicating in a peer-to-peer way, with an
 extensible family of connection types (tcp, udp, multicast, local, MPI,
 mjpg-over-http, XML/RPC, tcpros, ...) that can be swapped in and out to
 match your needs. It also supports similarly flexible interfacing
 with hardware devices.
 .
 This package contains architecture-independent supporting data files
 required for use with yarp, such as such as documentation, icons,
 and translations.
