 This file is created at Almende B.V. It is open-source
 software and part of the Common Hybrid Agent Platform
 (CHAP). A toolbox with a lot of open-source tools,
 ranging from thread pools and TCP/IP components to control
 architectures and learning algorithms. This software is
 published under the GNU Lesser General Public license
 (LGPL).
 .
 It is not possible to add usage restrictions to an
 open-source license. Nevertheless, we personally strongly
 object against this software used by the military, in the
 bio-industry, for animal experimentation, or anything that
 violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
