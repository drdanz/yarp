# Welcome to the configuration file for "@YARPY_DEV_LIB_NAME@".
#
# Typical usage from CMake:
#   FIND_PACKAGE(@YARPY_DEV_LIB_NAME@)
#   LINK_LIBRARIES(@YARPY_DEV_LIB_NAME@)
#
# To tell CMake about the location of this file, do:
#   SET(@YARPY_DEV_LIB_NAME@_DIR @YARPY_DEV_DIR@)
# Or configure an equivalent environment variable, or enter the
# path in the CMake GUI.
#
# In your code, you may need to call this method:
#   add_@YARPY_DEV_LIB_NAME@_devices();
# at the beginning of your program to make these devices available.
# This method is declared in add_@YARPY_DEV_LIB_NAME@_devices.h,
# or you can just declare it yourself as:
#   extern "C" void add_@YARPY_DEV_LIB_NAME@_devices()
# This call is automated if this library is built in to YARP -
# see the YARP documentation on adding a device.
